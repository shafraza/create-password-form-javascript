# Password Change Page

This project aims to create a password change page with a specific pattern that the user's new password should follow. The following features have been implemented:

- The page has the same design, colour scheme, and style as a reference page provided.
- The user can enter a new password and confirm it on the same page.
- An error message is displayed if the user's new password and confirmation password do not match.
- An error message is displayed if the user's new password does not follow the specified pattern.
- A red circle is shown instead of the green right circle that appears when the password is correct.
- The specific password pattern that the user's new password should follow includes:
  - At least one lowercase character (a-z)
  - At least one uppercase character (A-Z)
  - At least one special character (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;':",./<>?)
  - At least one numeric character (0-9)
  - Minimum length of 8 characters
